# What is Game Fitness?
 Application that recommends exercises based on sports activities to keep you healthy and ready for the game.

# Concept
  The idea of the application is primarily to create a profile for a user and pick a sports activity or multiple and based on his personal height, weight and BMI, provide a list of suggested exercies by cateogeries (stretching, strenght training etc.). The user can then perform this exercies for a certain period and provide more inputs on changes to his weight, BMI and other parameters.
 
# Team

The project team comprises of 3 (smart) members. As this is a small team, all of us plan to support all the different work (PO, Scrum Master, DEV, TESTING, Stake holder meet ups etc. at some point in the project).

- Andrew Shults (Product Owner/Lead Developer/Tester)
- Abdulmajeed Mesefir (Lead QA/Developer/StakeHolder Meet up)
- Shankar Chandrasekaran (Scrum Master/Developer/Tester)

This is a progressive team and we collaborate distributively using Git issues as can be seen in our estimates interaction.

# Project StakeHolder(s)

- Professor Wallace Chipidza
- Atheletes, Sports Enthusiast
 
# Project Requirements

- Build an application which provides customized/personolized list of exercises for a user based on his personal preferences and traits.
- The application should be able to track progress of the user traits and provide a visualize representation of the history of changes
- The application should also be able to categorize exercises (general cardio training vs swimming/running as options)
- Provide a guided tutorial/video/link to perform exercises 
 
# Technologies Used

We plan to use 
- Python : For Algorithms and business logic
- HTML, CSS, Javascript (along with a framework which we haven't picked yet ) : UI components/visualization
- SQlite : Database Engine/Data store
